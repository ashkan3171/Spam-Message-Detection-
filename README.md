Spam Message Detection Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. It preprocesses text, extracts features using TF-IDF, and trains a Logistic Regression model. The dataset is balanced using SMOTE, achieving 98% accuracy. Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning and deployment.

ðŸ“– Features

âœ… Preprocessing: Cleans text (removes punctuation, converts to lowercase, removes numbers).âœ… Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF vectorization to transform text into numerical format.âœ… Imbalanced Data Handling: Applies SMOTE to balance spam and ham messages.âœ… Model Training: Uses Logistic Regression for classification.âœ… Evaluation: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.
